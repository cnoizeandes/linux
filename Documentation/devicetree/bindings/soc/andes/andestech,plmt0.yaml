title: Andes Technology NCEPLMT100 Machine Timer

description:
  The RISC-V architecture defines a machine timer that provides a
  real-time counter and generates timer interrupts. NCEPLMT100 is an
  implementation of the machine timer.
  This timer is not to be confused with the real-time clock timer (RTC)
  of typical computing platforms. Per RISC-V privileged specification,
  the timer clock could be clocked at any arbitrary frequency as long as
  it is a fixed frequency clock that is not affected by clock gating or
  frequency scaling of clocks in the rest of the platform.
